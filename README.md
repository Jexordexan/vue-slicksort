## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slicksort):

```
  $ npm install vue-slicksort --save
```

Using yarn:

```
  $ yarn add vue-slicksort
```

Using a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-slicksort@latest/dist/vue-slicksort.min.js"></script>
```

Then, using a module bundler that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, such as [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack):

```js
// Using an ES6 transpiler like Babel
import { ContainerMixin, ElementMixin } from 'vue-slicksort';

// Not using an ES6 transpiler
var slicksort = require('vue-slicksort');
var ContainerMixin = slicksort.ContainerMixin;
var ElementMixin = slicksort.ElementMixin;
```

If you are loading the package via `<script>` tag:

```html
<script>
  var { ContainerMixin, ElementMixin, HandleDirective } = window.VueSlicksort;
</script>
```

## Usage

Check out the docs:  [vue-slicksort.netlify.app](https://vue-slicksort.netlify.app/)

<!-- 
## Usage

### Basic Example

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import { ContainerMixin, ElementMixin } from 'vue-slicksort';

const SortableList = {
  mixins: [ContainerMixin],
  template: `
    <ul class="list">
      <slot />
    </ul>
  `,
};

const SortableItem = {
  mixins: [ElementMixin],
  props: ['item'],
  template: `
    <li class="list-item">{{item}}</li>
  `,
};

const ExampleVue = {
  name: 'Example',
  template: `
    <div class="root">
      <SortableList lockAxis="y" v-model="items">
        <SortableItem v-for="(item, index) in items" :index="index" :key="index" :item="item"/>
      </SortableList>
    </div>
  `,
  components: {
    SortableItem,
    SortableList,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4', 'Item 5', 'Item 6', 'Item 7', 'Item 8'],
    };
  },
};

const app = new Vue({
  el: '#root',
  render: (h) => h(ExampleVue),
});
```

That's it! Vue Slicksort does not come with any styles by default, since it's meant to enhance your existing components.

## Slicksort components

There are two pre-built components that implement the two mixins. Use them like this:

```javascript
import { SlickList, SlickItem } from 'vue-slicksort';

const ExampleVue = {
  name: 'Example',
  template: `
    <div class="root">
      <SlickList lockAxis="y" v-model="items" tag="ul">
        <SlickItem v-for="(item, index) in items" :index="index" :key="index" tag="li">
          {{ item }}
        </SlickItem>
      </SlickList>
    </div>
  `,
  components: {
    SlickItem,
    SlickList,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4', 'Item 5', 'Item 6', 'Item 7', 'Item 8'],
    };
  },
};
``` -->

## Why should I use this?

There are already a number of great Drag & Drop libraries out there (for instance, [vuedraggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) is fantastic). If those libraries fit your needs, you should definitely give them a try first. However, most of those libraries rely on the HTML5 Drag & Drop API, which has some severe limitations. For instance, things rapidly become tricky if you need to support touch devices, if you need to lock dragging to an axis, or want to animate the nodes as they're being sorted. Vue Slicksort aims to provide a simple set of component mixins to fill those gaps. If you're looking for a dead-simple, mobile-friendly way to add sortable functionality to your lists, then you're in the right place.
<!-- 
## Customization and props

You apply options as individual `props` on whatever component is using the `ContainerMixin`. The component also emits several events during a sorting operation. Here's an example of a customized component:

```html
<SortableContainer
  :value="items"
  :transitionDuration="250"
  :lockAxis="'y'"
  :useDragHandle="true"
  @sort-start="onSortStart($event)"
>
</SortableContainer>
```

## `ContainerMixin`

### Props

#### `value` _(required)_

type: _Array_

The `value` can be inherited from `v-model` but has to be set to the same list that is rendered with `v-for` inside the `Container`

#### `axis`

type: _String_

default: `y`

Items can be sorted horizontally, vertically or in a grid. Possible values: `x`, `y` or `xy`

#### `lockAxis`

type: _String_

If you'd like, you can lock movement to an axis while sorting. This is not something that is possible with HTML5 Drag & Drop

#### `helperClass`

type: _String_

You can provide a class you'd like to add to the sortable helper to add some styles to it

#### `appendTo`

type: _String_

default: `body`

You can provide a querySelector string you'd like to add to the sorting element to add parent dom

#### `transitionDuration`

type: _Number_

default: `300`

The duration of the transition when elements shift positions. Set this to `0` if you'd like to disable transitions

#### `draggedSettlingDuration`

type: _Number_

default: `null`

Override the settling duration for the drag helper. If not set, `transitionDuration` will be used.

#### `pressDelay`

type: _Number_

default: `0`

If you'd like elements to only become sortable after being pressed for a certain time, change this property. A good sensible default value for mobile is `200`. Cannot be used in conjunction with the `distance` prop.

#### `pressThreshold`

type: _Number_

default: `5`

Number of pixels of movement to tolerate before ignoring a press event.

#### `distance`

type: _Number_

default: `0`

If you'd like elements to only become sortable after being dragged a certain number of pixels. Cannot be used in conjunction with the `pressDelay` prop.

#### `useDragHandle`

type: _Boolean_

default: `false`

If you're using the `HandleDirective`, set this to `true`

#### `useWindowAsScrollContainer`

type: _Boolean_

default: `false`

If you want, you can set the `window` as the scrolling container

#### `hideSortableGhost`

type: _Boolean_

default: `true`

Whether to auto-hide the ghost element. By default, as a convenience, Vue Slicksort List will automatically hide the element that is currently being sorted. Set this to false if you would like to apply your own styling.

#### `lockToContainerEdges`

type: _Boolean_

default: `false`

You can lock movement of the sortable element to it's parent `Container`

#### `lockOffset`

type: _`OffsetValue` or [ `OffsetValue`, `OffsetValue` ]_\*

default: `"50%"`

When `lockToContainerEdges` is set to `true`, this controls the offset distance between the sortable helper and the top/bottom edges of it's parent `Container`. Percentage values are relative to the height of the item currently being sorted. If you wish to specify different behaviours for locking to the _top_ of the container vs the _bottom_, you may also pass in an `array` (For example: `["0%", "100%"]`).

\* `OffsetValue` can either be a finite `Number` or a `String` made up of a number and a unit (`px` or `%`).
Examples: `10` (which is the same as `"10px"`), `"50%"`

#### `shouldCancelStart`

type: _Function_

default: [Function](https://github.com/Jexordexan/vue-slicksort/blob/master/src/ContainerMixin.js#L41)

This function is invoked before sorting begins, and can be used to programatically cancel sorting before it begins. By default, it will cancel sorting if the event target is either an `input`, `textarea`, `select` or `option`.

#### `getHelperDimensions`

type: _Function_

default: [Function](https://github.com/Jexordexan/vue-slicksort/blob/master/src/ContainerMixin.js#L49)

Optional `function({node, index})` that should return the computed dimensions of the SortableHelper. See [default implementation](https://github.com/Jexordexan/vue-slicksort/blob/master/src/ContainerMixin.js#L49) for more details

### Events

Events are emitted from the Container element, and can be bound to using `v-bind` or `@` directives

#### `@sort-start`

emits: `{ event: MouseEvent, node: HTMLElement, index: number }`

Fired when sorting begins.

#### `@sort-move`

emits: `{ event }`

Fired when the mouse is moved during sorting.

#### `@sort-end`

emits: `{ event, newIndex, oldIndex }`

Fired when sorting has ended.

#### `@input`

emits: `Array`

Fired after sorting has ended with the newly sorted list.

---

## `ElementMixin`

### Props

#### `index` _(required)_

type: _Number_

This is the element's sortableIndex within it's collection. This prop is required.

#### `collection`

**REMOVED IN v2.0.0**
Use `group` and multiple scroll containers instead.

type: _Number or String_

default: `0`

The collection the element is part of. This is useful if you have multiple groups of sortable elements within the same `Container`. [Example](http://Jexordexan.github.io/vue-slicksort/#/basic-configuration/multiple-lists)

#### `disabled`

type: _Boolean_

default: `false`

Whether the element should be sortable or not

## `HandleDirective`

The `v-handle` directive is used inside the draggable element.

The Container must have the `:useDragHandle` prop set to `true` for the handle to work as expected.

Here is an example for a simple element with a handle:

```html
<template>
  <li class="list-item">
    <span v-handle class="handle"></span>
    {{item.value}}
  </li>
</template>

<script>
  import { ElementMixin, HandleDirective } from 'vue-slicksort';

  export default {
    mixins: [ElementMixin],
    directives: { handle: HandleDirective },
  };
</script>
``` -->

# FAQ

<!-- ### Running Examples

In root folder:

```
	$ npm install
	$ npm run storybook
``` -->


### Upgrade from v1.x

There are a few changes in v2, mainly support for Vue 3 and dragging between groups. Read more about migrating here:
[vue-slicksort.netlify.app/migrating-1x](https://vue-slicksort.netlify.app/migrating-1x)

### Upgrade from v0.x

The event names have all changed from camelCase to dash-case to accommodate for inline HTML templates.

### Grid support?

Need to sort items in a grid? We've got you covered! Just set the `axis` prop to `xy`. Grid support is currently limited to a setup where all the cells in the grid have the same width and height, though we're working hard to get variable width support in the near future.

### Item disappearing when sorting / CSS issues

Upon sorting, `vue-slicksort` creates a clone of the element you are sorting (the _sortable-helper_) and appends it to the end of the `appendTo` tag. The original element will still be in-place to preserve its position in the DOM until the end of the drag (with inline-styling to make it invisible). If the _sortable-helper_ gets messed up from a CSS standpoint, consider that maybe your selectors to the draggable item are dependent on a parent element which isn't present anymore (again, since the _sortable-helper_ is at the end of the `appendTo` prop). This can also be a `z-index` issue, for example, when using `vue-slicksort` within a Bootstrap modal, you'll need to increase the `z-index` of the SortableHelper so it is displayed on top of the modal.

### Click events being swallowed

By default, `vue-slicksort` is triggered immediately on `mousedown`. If you'd like to prevent this behaviour, there are a number of strategies readily available. You can use the `distance` prop to set a minimum distance (in pixels) to be dragged before sorting is enabled. You can also use the `pressDelay` prop to add a delay before sorting is enabled. Alternatively, you can also use the [HandleDirective](https://github.com/Jexordexan/vue-slicksort/blob/master/src/HandleDirective.js).

### Scoped styles

If you are using scoped styles on the sortable list, you can use `appendTo` prop.

## Dependencies

Slicksort has no dependencies.
`vue` is the only peerDependency

## Thanks

This library is heavily based on [react-sortable-hoc](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc) by ClaudÃ©ric Demers (@clauderic). A very simple and low overhead implementation of drag and drop that looks and performs great!
